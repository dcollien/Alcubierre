Alcubierre
==========

A rogue-like space adventure/simulation game.

Some strange mix between FTL and The Sims

Current goals:
 - create ship builder interface: ability to create rooms with doors between them on a grid
 - multiple crew with clicking to move crew between rooms, doors sliding open for them automatically
 - interface for placing equipment inside rooms: bridge, engine, control panels, etc.
